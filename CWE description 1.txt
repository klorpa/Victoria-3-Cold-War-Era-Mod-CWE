[h1]Notice:[/h1]
[b]Errors & Content:[/b] The mod is still in a very early stage so bugs, missing content and the occasional crash can be expected. Game balance will also not be good.

[b]Performance:[/b] The mod will run slower than vanilla due to the large number of buildings and pops present in the game. Please see the FAQ section for some sample performance times.

[b]Linux Users:[/b] You might need to delete the 'fonts' folder of the mod if the localisation text for the UI is missing. This is because the fonts in this mod may be incompatible with linux.

[b]1946 Start Date:[/b] You can play the mod in 1946 by running this mod concurrently with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3249824317]Cold War Era Mod (1946) sub mod[/url].

[h1]About the mod[/h1]
The Cold War Era mod (CWE) brings Victoria 3 into the Cold War era and beyond. This mod contains a slew of special features such as nuclear war systems, dynamic international organisations and decolonisation chains to accurately simulate the Cold War and Post-Cold War world. Politics and the economy have also been completely overhauled to allow the game engine to represent the modern era.

[h1]Current Features:[/h1]
- New goods, PMs & buildings
- New laws & redone government types
- Edited military system
- Edited tech tree
- Overhauled ideologies & IGs
- Corruption system
- Functional UN (IMF, Peacekeeping, Sanctions & Membership)
- Functional Nuclear War system
- Economic Outlook system
- Some historical events for decolonisation, wars and revolutions
- Country flags & leaders for countries in 1950
- Space Race
- Superstates

[h1]Future plans:[/h1]
- Complete the historical events
- Add more historical organisations

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
1. What is the mod's time frame? -> 1950 to 2092
2. Why are some localisations for events missing? -> It is to speed up progress of the mod.
3. What is the difference between this mod and other cold war mods? -> This mod uses a different ideology (based on V2 style issue support) and sphere of influence system (using Client States).
4. Why is the tech tree like HOI4? -> It is for the ease of editing and balancing the techs whenever PMs or buildings need to be changed. It also avoids the need to put 100s of techs in a giant tech tree spaghetti to cover all the technological innovations over the last 100 and next 100 years.
5. Why is the economy having X problem? -> Balancing the economy needs a lot of time. We are not a company and we don't have enough manpower to just run the game for hours to check changes to the economy. 
6. Can you just use the vanilla buildings instead? -> The vanilla buildings were not balanced for 1950 and so any attempt to just port over them will still lead to similar economic problems. You will know if you have ever tried running the game past 1936. Also, people will then complain that the economy is incomplete because X modern good is not represented.
7. Why are there 'national identity' cultures? -> Due to V3 using cultural homelands and not country tags to set cores, those cultures are necessary to prevent the wrong countries from being released during uprisings and to mark various territories as being part of a particular state. So for example, without the German or Austrian cultures, there can be a uprising to release Austria in Alsace Lorraine because that is a South German homeland. If there is no Russo-Eurasian culture, then all Soviet states will have to marked with Russian homelands. If there is no British culture then a Great Britain revolt may occur in England instead of an English revolt. The same problem will be made worse in places like Africa where the cultural distribution does not follow the actual national borders. Using the vanilla way will therefore lead to massive ahistorical border gore so using national identities instead is necessary to prevent this problem.
8. What is the performance of the mod like? -> It is slower than vanilla. Here are some sample times using my computer:
- 1951: 5 min 26 sec
- 1975: 7 min 19 sec
- 1900 (vanilla performance benchmark save): 4 min 00 sec
